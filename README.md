Code to produce Chapter 9 of Forestry Statistics using UN Food and Agricultural Organisation Public Data.

## Data Sources

Data for Chapter 9 of Forestry Statistics comes from two sources. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 5-yearly Global Forest Resources Assessment (for which Forest Research produces the UK return) and the FAOSTAT Forestry Production and Trade platform (for which Forest Research produces the annual UK return through the Joint Forest Sector Questionnaire).

## Data Downloads

Statistics on forest cover, forest area by country, annual changes in forest area and forest carbon stocks come from the [Global Forest Resources Assessment data platform](https://fra-data.fao.org/assessments/fra/2020/WO/home/overview). There are toggle option menus for most available tables to select year, variable and country. For easier replication by minimising manual steps, full data has been downloaded for each required table with all selecting and processing occurring on our end.

Data for Table 9.1 comes from [1a Extent of forest and other wooded land](https://fra-data.fao.org/assessments/fra/2020/WO/sections/extentOfForest).

Data for Table 9.2 comes from [1d Annual forest expansion, deforestation and net change](https://fra-data.fao.org/assessments/fra/2020/WO/sections/forestAreaChange).

Data for Table 9.3 comes from [2d Carbon Stock](https://fra-data.fao.org/assessments/fra/2020/WO/sections/carbonStock).

Statistics on wood removals, production of wood products, apparent consumption of wood products and world trade in forest products come from the [FAOSTAT Forestry Production and Trade Platform](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FO). There are toggle option menus for countries/special groups/regions, elements, items and years. As before, we do full downloads and do all processing on our end. There is a bulk download available in the side menu. We want 'All data Normalized' which is tidy-ish.
